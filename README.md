1.  Demographic info - This box contains general demographic info for the test subject: ethnicity, gender, age, where they live, type of belly button, and washing frequency.
1. A bar chart that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in that test subjects belly button.
1. A gauge chart showing the number of times per week the test subject washes their belly button.
1.  A bubble chart showing all of the bacteria cultures per sample.
